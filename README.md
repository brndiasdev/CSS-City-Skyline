# City Skyline
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iUg1SOW.png" alt="css city skyline">

A simple HTML and CSS code that creates a city skyline with changing colors based on the width of the window. The skyline transitions between day and night themes using CSS `@media` queries.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/brndiasdev/CSS-City-Skyline
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Explore the city skyline with changing colors based on the window width.

## Customization

You can customize the colors of the buildings and windows by modifying the CSS variables defined in the `:root` selector of the `styles.css` file. Simply update the hexadecimal color codes to your desired colors.

```css
:root {
  --building-color1: #aa80ff;
  --building-color2: #66cc99;
  --building-color3: #cc6699;
  --building-color4: #538cc6;
  --window-color1: #bb99ff;
  --window-color2: #8cd9b3;
  --window-color3: #d98cb3;
  --window-color4: #8cb3d9;
}
```

Feel free to experiment and make the skyline your own!
